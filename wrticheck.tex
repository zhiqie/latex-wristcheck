\noindent \colorbox{white}{THEREFORE IN CONSIDERATION of the premises, the covenants and agreements herein}\\ 
\colorbox{white}{contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of}\\ 
\colorbox{white}{which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:}
  
\noindent 1. \colorbox{white}{Sale by Consignment. The Consignee will accept products for consignment from the}\\ 
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{consignor. Consignor shall provide the consignee with an inventory list and prices for items. }\\
\colorbox{white}{The consignor will help label and price the products with the item information. The} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{consignor will provide a detailed inventory list, i.e.\# / Brand / Item Description / Price /}\\ 
\colorbox{white}{Suggested Price Floor in electronic format such as Excel or Google Sheets. Consignor will }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{retain his/her own copy of this inventory list. Consignee may not discount the items.}

\noindent 2. \colorbox{white}{Ownership of Products. The items belong to the Consignor until they are sold by the}\\ 
\colorbox{white}{Consignee. The Consignor can remove them from the Wristcheck Exchange Limited’s}\\ 
\colorbox{white}{digital platform (the “Platform”) by providing the Consignee ten days prior written notice (the }\\
\colorbox{white}{“Notice”). Title to, and property and ownership in, all Products shall remain with the}\\
\colorbox{white}{Consignor until such time as their removal may be directed in writing by the Consignor or}\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{until such time as they may be disposed of by bona fide sale by.}

\noindent3. \colorbox{white}{Payment for Products. If an item is sold, the Consignee will be paid 8.0\%of the final sale }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{price excluding taxes and credit card fees. The Consignee will collect all payments from }\\
\colorbox{white}{any and all sales.}

\noindent4. \colorbox{white}{Pricing: Consignee will be marking up 4 \% of the Seller Price as buyers premium, and this} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{will not be attributed to Consignor as part of Seller Price.}

\noindent5. \colorbox{white}{Condition of Products. The Consignee will keep the Products free from any lien, security }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{interest or encumbrance adverse to the ownership interest of the Consignor, and shall}\\

\noindent 7. \colorbox{white}{Theft / Damage / Returns. If the Consignor transfers physical possession of the Products} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{to the Consignee, the Consignee will use reasonable efforts to provide to assure no} \\

\sethlcolor{white}\hl{chargeback and the Consignee loses the funds, the merchandise will be considered as}\\
\colorbox{white}{stolen and Consignee shall not be responsible for such loss. The Consignee, at its} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{discretion, may authorize a short seven day return period. If an item is returned in the same} \\
\colorbox{white}{condition it was sold, it will be re-displayed on the Platform at the original price and the sale} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{will be voided. }

\colorbox{white}{“Indemnified Party”) against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{actions, judgements, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of }\\
\colorbox{white}{whatever kind, including attorneys’ fees, that are incurred by the Indemnified Party resulting }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{from any third-party litigation arising out of any misrepresentation made by the Consignor or} \\
\colorbox{white}{the Consignor’s failure to perform any of its obligations. The Consignee and any of its}\\
\colorbox{white}{affiliates (including Wristcheck Experience Limited) shall be held harmless and not liable for }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{the status of physically consigned Products in any offline, physical store or space. The }\\
\colorbox{white}{Consignor agrees to hold harmless the Consignee and any of its affiliates (including} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{Wristcheck Experience Limited) for physically consigned Products. }

\sethlcolor{white}\hl{Consignee needs to vacate the premises or otherwise chooses to reutilise the interior store }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{space, then the Consignor may receive a text, email or phone call indicating to come pick }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{up or schedule a pre-paid FedEx/UPS pickup for the products within three days. If the }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{products are not picked up, they will become shop property. }

\noindent 10. \colorbox{white}{The Consignor represents that he or she has not entered into any agreement that would }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{prohibit it from performing all of its duties under this agreement without breaching such} \\
\colorbox{white}{other agreement. From the date of this agreement, the consignor shall not enter into any} \\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{agreement that would prohibit it from performing all of its duties under this agreement }\\
\sethlcolor{white}\hl{without breaching such other agreement. }
